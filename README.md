# Pantheon Lab Solution
This is a solution to Pantheon Lab full-stack development assignment created with JavaScript.

## Motivation and messages
JavaScript is used to implement the algorithms because of its extensive built-in methods, e.g., `sort()` and `map()`, as well as its ability to work with web browser. 
Logics and explanations of the program are included thorughout the program file. `algorithm_analysis.pdf` contains analysis of the time complexity and space complexity. 

## How to run
Run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pearlpisut/pantheon-lab-solution.git

npm init
```
The program is implemented `main.js`, while the input data is received from `info.js`, where user can make adjustments. Outputs can be viewed in `index.html` via web
browser.
